hey thanks for reading. the reason you need to install the extension is because this is a serverless application, and everything runs in the browser. it's a security vulnerability to allow loading content from websites outside of your domain, but in this case the program only loads from pdf websites so the risk should be small. the extension basically tells your browser to ignore the domain restriction, and it's recommended to set it up to only work for the pdf tool's domain.
